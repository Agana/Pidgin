      This book approaches Pidgin English in a systematic fashion. We go through the basic grammatical elements, and work our way up through grammatical functions, parts of speech, and then how the language works on a sentence level.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Examples are used throughout to illustrate concepts, and each chapter has one or more practice exercices with answers at the end of the book.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      There is also a small glossary of common Pidgin English words and phrases and some great tips on having successful conversations in Pidgin English.
