    Sentences
  </h1>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown4" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Now that we have the boilerplate out of the way, we are ready to look at what we actually speak in Pidgin as well as in any language: sentences. These are the predominant units of meaning we pass to each other everyday in speaking and writing.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A sentence, being made of at least one clause, has three parts, known as grammatical elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Subject
      </li>
      <li>
        Verb
      </li>
      <li>
        Predicate
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter2Sentences-heading12" style="color:#000000;">
    The Subject
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown14" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The subject of a sentence is defined as the word or group of words that denote the performer of the main verb in the sentence. In Pidgin English the subject of a sentence works in much the same way as in regular English.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      We will consider nouns later in Chapter on Nouns.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter2Sentences-heading13" style="color:#000000;">
    Types of Subjects
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown15" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      There are three types of subjects
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Simple subject
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          A single subject consists of only one word as a subject, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p style="color:#000000;">
              Atongo be the boss.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p style="color:#000000;">
              A dey go school.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In the above sentence, Atongo is a simple subject.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Compound Subject
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          A compound subject is made up of two or more words joined by a coordinating conjunction, usually “den”1. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kwame den Ama wan marry.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In the above sentence, “Kwame den Ama” are joined by the coordinating conjunction “den”, meaning “and”.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Complete Subject
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          A complete subject consists of at least one noun and one or more words. The other words modify or give more information about the noun(s). For example, in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dema govment be wack
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      &quot;Govment&quot; is the noun, but &quot;dema&quot; tells us whose government is bad.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ma boy boga
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      We know that Joe is the one who has travelled abroad (to boga *2). But Ma boy also tells us that Joe is the speaker’s friend (or son).
    </p>

    Predicates
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown16" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The Predicate The predicate of a sentence is the part of that sentence which contains the main verb and any other words and which says something about the subject. The word comes from the Latin predicare, which means to declare. The predicate declares
      something about the subject. What is the subject doing? Where is the subject going? How does the subject look? It’s the predicate that declares that.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      There are three forms of the predicate, just as with the subject, and the basis of classification is pretty much the same.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4 id="chapter2Sentences-heading15" style="color:#000000;">
    Simple Predicate
  </h4>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown17" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Sometimes a sentence has just a subject and a verb. In that case, the lone verb is the predicate, and is called a simple predicate. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        E come. (Meaning he has come, or he came)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In this example, E (“he” with the h stripped away) is the subject, and come, the verb, is the simple predicate. Other examples are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The man bore. (Meaning The man is angry)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Me den Kwame cry. (Meaning Kwame and I cried)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h4 id="chapter2Sentences-heading16" style="color:#000000;">
    Compound Predicate
  </h4>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown18" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      A compound predicate, like a compound subject, merely consists of two verbs joined by a coordinating conjunction, again, usually den. In Pidgin English, the conjunction den is usually omitted from the construction. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Majeed come cry. (Meaning Majeed came and cried, or Majeed, come and cry.)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In this example in regular English, Majeed came and cried. Came and cried is a compound predicate because it has two verbs, (came, cried), joined by the conjunction and. The pidgin equivalent would be: Majeed come den cry. But den is often omitted. This
      allows the statement to have a pasent and a past meaning as seen above. When it is added, the meaning can only be the present form as given. It will also usually be in imperative (command) mood like in the example.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      More examples of compound predicates:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The oga himself go fight.*3
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (Meaning The boss himself went and fought)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The men for giddup den talk.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (The men must stand up (or get up) and speak)
    </p>
  </div>
  <h4 id="chapter2Sentences-heading17" style="color:#000000;">
    Complete Predicate
  </h4>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown19" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Just like the complete subject, the complete predicate consists of the verb and any other word or words that provide information about the subject. They may be adverbs, adjectives, or any other words.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      For our first example, let us turn the compound predicate in Majeed come cry into a complete predicate:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Majeed come cry for here.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (Meaning Majeed came and cried here)
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Simply by adding for here, we have upgraded the predicate. We have added just two words and now we know where Majeed came and cried. But a complete predicate does not need to first be compound. For example, we can say:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Majeed cry for here. (Meaning Majeed cried here)
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      This is also a complete predicate because it completes the idea of his crying by telling us where it happened. More examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A/I tire rough. *4
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (I am very tired)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The policeman come bab am.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (The policeman came and arrested him)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You spoil my plans all.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (You have messed up all my plans)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Charlie dey go house today.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      (Charlie is going home today)
    </p>

    Other Grammatical Elements
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter2Sentences-markdown20" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Verbs
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The verbs themselves are a grammatical element in a sentence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Complement
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Sometimes the predicate is also a complement. This happens when the main verb is “is” or “are”. For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            My father is good.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:#000000;">
      [1] Den is from the English “then”. It is also a contraction of the full “and then”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      [2] The term was made popular In the ‘80s and ‘90s Ghanaians who returned from Hamburg were first called Hamburgers, the burgers, and finally today, bogas. Further, the word has now become a verb meaning to travel abroad.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      [3] Go can also mean “will”, given the context. We will explore that in Chapter Eight.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      [4] “I” in Pidgin is pronounced with the “a” sound in “bat”
