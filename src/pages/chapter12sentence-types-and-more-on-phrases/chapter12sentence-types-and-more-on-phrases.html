    Sentence Types & More on Phrases
  </h1>
  <div id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-markdown84" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Before considering how the various types of sentences work in Pidgin, it is useful to review two more types of phrases: adverbial and adjectival.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-heading89" style="color:#000000;">
    Adverbial Phrases
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-markdown85" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Adverbial Phrases Pidgin English does not often translate adverbial phrases like:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      As long as As a matter of fact In/for the meantime Inasmuch as On second thought Rather than
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Such phrases are used in their normal English form. Notice for example that in “As a matter of fact” the indefinite article “a” is preserved, even though it does not normally exist in Pidgin.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The same can be said of phrases that act as adjectives:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      They are a
      <strong>
        very badly dressed
      </strong>
      couple
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Very badly dressed is an adverbial phrase, but it describes “couple” like an adjective. Pidgin would say:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Them be a
      <strong>
        very badly dressed
      </strong>
      * couple.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Again, notice that the article is preserved.
    </p>

    Sentence Types Based on Function
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-markdown86" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Sentences are also classified according to their grammatical complexity. Again there are four groups:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Simple sentences
      </li>
      <li>
        Compound sentences
      </li>
      <li>
        Complex sentences
      </li>
      <li>
        Compound-Complex sentences
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-heading91" style="color:#000000;">
    Simple Sentences
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter12SentenceTypesAndMoreOnPhrases-markdown87" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      These are sentences that contain only one independent clause. An independent clause is one that conveys full meaning without the need of any other clauses. A good example of a simple sentence is:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I go school for the rain inside   (I went to school in the rain)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      This sentence has only one independent clause. Simple sentences are not necessarily short. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As a soldier with a duty to protect and an honour to preserve, you need to be fearless.
      </li>
    </ul>
