      Pidgin English is spoken widely across West Africa. It is similar enough across English-speaking West Africa that it is possible to understand the various flavours once you have learned any one of them.

      It used to be associated with the less educated, whose English was bad or “broken.” So it has been called Broken English for a long time. However in recent times a linguistic difference has emerged between the two, owing largely to the fact that Pidgin
      English has become more and more standard amongst speakers. The result is that there are now generally accepted ways to say things in Pidgin, just as there are in any other language. There is now correct Pidgin and wrong Pidgin, as it were, though
      in Pidgin we must guard against the idea of rules. Broken English on the other hand is simply wrong English. Pidgin English is what a middle aged middle to upper class Ghanaian who is fluent in regular English would speak with his friends; Broken
      English is what a non-native English speaker would attempt in an English speaking society. If stereotypes are anything to go by, that is.

      In this book we focus on Ghanaian Pidgin. As earlier stated it is similar enough to say, Nigerian Pidgin that you will already be comfortable in very many speaking situations across the sub region. This is our focus because it is the Pidgin I know well
      enough to write about, and I happen to think it is the nicer of the two :-).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      This book is for three groups of people. The first group is foreigners who are visiting Ghana and want an easy introduction to this fantastic language. It will open up most social situations almost immediately because it is spoken everywhere, and it will
      endear you instantly to an already very hospitable Ghanaian society.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The second group of people is Ghanaians who speak Pidgin English with the notion that they are doing something haphazard or thoughtless. It is to prove to you that together, unconsciously; we have created a beauty of a language, with regular predictable
      form worthy of the name of Grammar.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Lastly it is for people interested in the evolution of language, whether academically or casually. This book offers a snapshot of the present form of Pidgin in Ghana, and will be useful as a source of research or teaching.

      The book is written in a semi-formal, sometimes conversational style. There are practice exercises with answers at the end of the book to help you sharpen up.

      I really enjoyed writing this book; I hope you will enjoy reading it just as much.
