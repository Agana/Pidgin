    Prepositions
  </h1>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown59" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Prepositions are words that connect pars of a sentence. Really, that’s all they are, and they do that in different senses. They are not all about location and position. They are called prepositions because syntactically they come before the nouns they
      append to the preceding part of the sentence. There are various kinds.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading61" style="color:#000000;">
    HeadPrepositions of Location
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown60" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      These are words and phrases that indicate location. Some word examples are: “to”, “in”, “around”, “near”, “adjacent”, and “opposite”. Some phrasal prepositions of location are: “far away from”, “very close to”, “right next to”, and “some distance into”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin handles various prepositions of location differently.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “To” and “in” are often dropped:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We dey go town    (We’re going to town)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey Ghana     (He is in Ghana)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          My girlfriend dey Labone   (My girlfriend is in Labone)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I for come your country    (I must come to your country)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “From” is used just the same:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey come from town   (I am coming from town)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I get this from there     (I got this from there)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Around” “beside” and “near” usually become “him body”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I dey the house him body   (I am at the house’s body --&gt; I am near/around/beside the house)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Remember, this is possessive. Literally, the speaker is saying he is at the house’s body.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      But you can also say:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I dey near the house    (I am near the house)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      We should pause here to say a word about the “dey” form of the verb “To be”. We’ve seen that this form is often used as an auxiliary or in non-substantive situations. One of these non-substantive situations is prepositional. The verb “dey” in this context
      means “To be at” or “To be in”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin English -- Regular English
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I dey -- I am at/in
      </li>
      <li>
        You dey -- You are at/in
      </li>
      <li>
        E dey -- He/She/It is at/in
      </li>
      <li>
        We dey -- We are at/in
      </li>
      <li>
        You dey -- You are at/in
      </li>
      <li>
        Them dey -- They are at/in
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Now we can take another look at the statement:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I dey the house him body
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      and see that it translates first to “I am at the house’s body”. Body here is used to indicate proximity, hence the final meaning “I am hear/around the house”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Otherwise, most other prepositions of location work just as they do in regular English. Here are some more examples:
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading62" style="color:#000000;">
    Prepositions of Movement
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown61" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      When there is movement involved, many place prepositions function as prepositions of direction. An of course, there are specifically directional ones as well.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “To” is often left out, just like it often is in regular English:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I take the flowers give am   (I gave the flowers to her/I gave her the flowers)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          George start dey go school   (George has started going to school)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Towards” is replaced with “come” when the movement is in the direction of the speaker, and with “go” or “go near” when it is away from the speaker:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey walk come this house   (He is walking towards this house)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey walk go that house   (He is walking towards that house)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading63" style="color:#000000;">
    Prepositions of Position
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown62" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Location deals with places like cities, countries, states and regions. Position deals with the same idea on a much smaller scale. The noun of reference is usually small or at least very local. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Put the book on the table
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          What’s that on your head?
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Hide it in a hole
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          He’s standing under a tree
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I know what lies in the heart of a king
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Here, too, there are some differences in how some common prepositions are used. But generally speaking, the idea of possession is inherent, even if latent.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “In” used with the verb “to be”, ie “dey”, becomes the noun plus “inside” with an optional “for”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          What dey (for) your hand inside?   (What’s in your hand?)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey (for) meeting inside    (He is in a meeting)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Bird dey (for) the tree inside    (There is a bird in the tree)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I know *1 what dey (for) king him heart inside
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “In” with any other verb becomes “for” plus the noun plus “inside”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Hide am for hole inside    (Hide it in a hole)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I see bird for the tree inside          (I saw a bird in the tree)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          He for be alert for the meeting inside    (She must be alert in the meeting)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “On” plus “dey” becomes the noun plus “top”, with an optional “for” before the noun:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          What e dey your head top?   (What is (that) on your head?)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey top     (I’m on it)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The bread dey lie the table top     (The bread is lying on the table)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Less commonly:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey for top
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The bread dey lie for the table top
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “On” plus other verbs always becomes “for” plus the noun plus “top”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Put am for the table top    (Put it on the table)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I see spot for him face top    (I saw a spot on her face)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “Under” becomes “unders” and follows the same pattern pattern with “dey” and other verbs as does “on”. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey stand the tree him unders    (She’s standing under the tree)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Nothing new dey the sun him unders    (There’s nothing new under the sun)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      You’ll notice the extra word “him” that comes before the preposition. This recalls the possessive aspect we have mentioned. It is visible in the case of “unders”, but latent in the cases of “in”, “on”. Some speakers actually choose to use it in those
      cases. So, equally valid are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bird dey the tree him inside
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey for him top
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The bread dey lie for the table him top
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Put am for the table him top
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I see spot for him face him top
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      This visibly possessive form was commoner in the past, and is the historical antecedent of the current form in which “him” does not occur. We say it is latent because, for example, the first sentence literally translates this way:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bird dey the tree him inside    (There is a bird inside of the tree)
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey for him top    (I am on top of it)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Put am for the table him top    (Put it on top of the table)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Hide am for hole him inside    (Hide it in the inside of a hole)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading65" style="color:#000000;">
    Prepositions of Time
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown63" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      These prepositions indicate place in time or duration. Some of them are: “during”, “in”, “over”, and “before”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “During”, “In” and their synonyms follow the pattern of the preposition of position “in”. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I go visit Ghana (for) March inside   (I will visit Ghana in  March)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          My feet freeze (for) the performance inside   (My feet froze during the performance)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Otherwise, the others function normally as in regular English:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I do am over three days    (I did it over three days)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Pray before you bed    (Pray before you sleep)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I go ask until you tell me    (I will ask until you tell me)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading66" style="color:#000000;">
    Prepositions of Reason
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown64" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Prepositions of reason are words and phrases that indicate causation, intent, or purpose. They include because, because of, due to, so, for, and in order to. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I came to see you
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We stayed at home because of the rain
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I bought the kelewele for Dwight.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In Pidgin English, prepositions of reason are also treated variously.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The Pidgin term “sakeof” (in regular English, “for the sake of”, or “because”) is often used to express reason:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I come sakeof I want see you   (I came (because I want) to see you) More frequently it will be stated as &quot;Sake of I want see you wey I come&quot; i.e.: It is because I want to see you that I came
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          He wear hat sake of e want impress am   (He wore a hat in order to impress her)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I come sakeof you call   (I came because you called)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We stay house sakeof the rain   (We stayed at home because of the rain)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “For” is often replaced with “give”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I go pray give you    (I will pray for you)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I buy this house give you    (I bought this house for you)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Note, however, that when in regular English “For” is used (archaically) to mean “because of”, as in “For this cause”, or “For the sake of”, then the preposition sakeof will apply.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter8Prepositions-heading67" style="color:#000000;">
    Prepositions of Instrument
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter8Prepositions-markdown65" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Sometimes we want to show that an action was accomplished using something as a tool, effector or aid. We call this an instrument, and the preposition that connects it to the rest of the sentence is a preposition of instrument. The commonest ones are,
      “with” and “by”. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We will go to Cape Coast by trotro
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Joe opened it with a knife
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      While Pidgin English does allow a direct translation, the more common form is to say:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The subject – (optional auxiliary) - “take” - the instrument – verb - the object
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Let’s illustrate that with the two sentences we’ve just seen:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Subject “Take” Instrument Verb Object: - We go take trotro go Cape Coast - Joe Take Knife Gbele am
    </p>

      It is actually pretty straightforward. The formula is a fixed one, no matter how many instruments are involved. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I won her heart with a song, a smile, and a flower
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      becomes
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I take song den flower den smile win him heart
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      We simply concatenate the list of instruments with the conjunction den (“and”).
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      All this said, and like we’ve mentioned, there are those who will simply replace the preposition “with” with “plus”, the pidgin equivalent, so we have:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We go go Cape Coast plus trotro    (We will go to Cape Coast by trotro)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Joe open am plus knife     (Joe opened it with a knife)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p style="color:#000000;">
      There are other types of prepositions: manner, support, and opposition being a few. Many of the same prepositional words and phrases we’ve seen are used in these types. For example “with” and “in” for manner, “for” for support. The normal rules for these
      words apply, so if you’ve comfortable with prepositions so far, you shold be fine with these other types without thinking too much about them. That said, we will look at just one more, the preposition of opposition “against”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      There are two equaly common way in which this word is used. First, as a verb (gainst) meaning “To oppose”:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey gainst me all the time    (He opposes me all the time)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You no for gainst your Dad like that    (You shouldn’t oppose your father like that)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Second, it is used as a true preposition. Here, either “gainst” or “against” can be used:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Esme vote gainst the plan     (Esme voted against the plan)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Kim play well against him coach  (Kim played well against her coach)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
