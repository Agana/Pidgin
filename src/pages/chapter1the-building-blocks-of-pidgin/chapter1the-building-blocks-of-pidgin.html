    The Building Blocks of Pidgin

    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Every language has grammatical units, and Pidgin English uses the same units as regular English does:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Letters
      </li>
      <li>
        Words
      </li>
      <li>
        Phrases
      </li>
      <li>
        Clauses
      </li>
      <li>
        Sentences
      </li>

  <div id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-markdown22" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin English in most instances relies on the English alphabet. There are a few instances in which pronunciation requires non-English alphabets, but they are few enough that we will simply cover them when we come across those instances.

    Words and Phrases
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-markdown23" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Words Words are not merely sounds like letters; they are the smallest units of complete meaning. If I said the word “Fox”, you’d have a complete idea of the animal, provided you already know the association between the two.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin English, being a mere vernacular of the English language, is mostly made of the English word stock. But it does add quite a number of new words, some derived from the local languages that influence it, others from witty adaptations on existing
      English words. We’ll cover some vocabulary as we go through the lessons so we can relate them to their contexts and functions.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In addition there is a short glossary of Pidgin English terms at the end of the book.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Phrases Phrases are a collection of words that lack a subject and a predicate. We’ll look at subjects and predicates in the next chapter. Being a string of words, phrases do offer some meaning, usually incomplete. Some examples are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Wona paddies (Our friends)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Shooting cars (To sell cars/selling cars)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Long journey (A long journey)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      When a phrase’s major unit is a noun, it is called a nominal phrase; when a verb, a verbal phrase; when an adjective, an adjectival phrase, and so on. Most types of phrases are used in Pidgin English. A few, like participial phrases, do not.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Participial phrases use the participle forms of verbs in ways that function as adjectives. For example, see the bold phrases in the following sentences:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Knowing he was a lover of art, I was sure to find him in the gallery.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          He ran quickly to church, alerted by the bell of his lateness
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          He sat happily at the table, licking his fingers and looking into his empty plate.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In each of those sentences the participial verb is describing a person (a noun). This construction does not occur at all in Pidgin English. Pidgin instead uses conjunctions to create a narrative flow:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          As I know say den e be art lover…
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          (Since I knew he was an art lover…)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E boot sharp go church, sake of the bell make he konw say e make late (He ran quickly to church, because the bell alerted him
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          [literally, made him aware] that he was late)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E tap for the table happily, wey den e dey lick him fingers dey pop him empty plate inside.
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          (He sat happily at the table, and he was licking his fingers and looking into his empty plate.)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We will consider a few other types of phrases under the Adverbs and Adjectives sections.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3 id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-heading22" style="color:#000000;">
    Clauses
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-markdown24" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Clauses are groups of words that have a subject and a predicate. Some examples are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Anytime you go arrive bia (Whenever you arrive)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The man wey e speak (The man who spoke)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Hope be essential (Hope is essential)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      As you can see, clauses are quite meaningful. In terms of construction clauses are pretty similarly used in regular and in Pidgin English. Differences are mainly those of vocabulary.
    </p>

  <h3 id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-heading23" style="color:#000000;">
    Sentences
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter1TheBuildingBlocksOfPidgin-markdown25" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Sentences bring it all together. A sentence is really one or more clauses that convey(s) a complete thought.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      For example, “Whenever you arrive” is quite meaningful, but begs the question what will happen or what I want you to do whenever you arrive. However,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I will be available to see you whenever you arrive
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      actually completes the thought. Pidgin English uses sentences too.
