    Adjectives
  </h1>
  <div id="chapter5Adjectives-markdown31" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Adjectives are words, phrases or clauses that describe nouns. Regular English has two constructions, the attributive and the predicative.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In the attributive use of adjectives, the adjective usually comes before the noun, forming a complete subject or a complete object. In the predicative form, it comes after the verb, and is part of the complete predicate of the sentence.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      For example, in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The red car has arrived
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The adjective “red” is used attributively. However, in:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          “The car is red”
        </p>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          “The car looks red”
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The adjective “red” is used predicatively. In pidgin, both uses occur, and in the same way. You’d therefore hear:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The red car come catch        (The red car has arrived)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The car be red        (The car is red)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The car dey look red    (The car looks red)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In “The car is red”, “red” is considered a complement of “the car” because the verb “is” establishes an equivalence between them: you could also say, “Red is the car”. In this form of the predicative use of adjectives (where the verb to be is used), pidgin
      often omits the verb. It is therefore standard to hear
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          “The car red” instead of “The car be red”, and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          “The guy tall”, instead of “The guy be tall”
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    On Types and Orders
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter5Adjectives-markdown32" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin English does not care so much for conventions around order of adjectives in a sentence, or types of adjectives. However, it is reasonable to say that the normal categories (color, shape &amp; size, age, material, origin, subjective, objective),
      apply.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      As for the Royal Order of adjectives, which says that certain adjectives should come before others, pidgin makes no special effort to comply. However, most speakers will use the regular English order, not because it is pidgin, but because it is second
      nature in speech.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The lazy old Ghanaian man come (The lazy old Ghanaian man has come)
      </li>
    </ul>

    Cooler Adjectives

  <div id="chapter5Adjectives-markdown33" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Where Pidgin English does show some stylistic concern for adjectives is in the precise forms that certain common ones take. Usually – but not always - intuitive contractions on longer words. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Beautiful - becomes - b or bee
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Big - becomes - bola
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Ugly - becomes - og
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Embarrassing - becomes - shyous
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Small - becomes - queer
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Fast - becomes - sharp
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Intelligent - becomes - shark
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Stingy - becomes - brown
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Fearful - becomes - terror
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Difficult - becomes - tight
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Is difficult - becomes - tron1

    Comparative forms of Adjectives
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter5Adjectives-markdown34" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Comparative forms of Adjectives An important aspect of speaking is comparing things. We usually do so my using words that relate relative magnitude, intensity or some other comparable quality. The regular English norm is to have the following basic structure:
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Positive - Comparative - Superlative
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Big - Bigger - Biggest
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Good - Better - Best
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Bad - Worse - Worst
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Pidgin English can use this construction, but prefers to keep the positive form of the word, and to use the term pass in place of the comparator than. Here are some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Kwame tall pass him poppie (Kwame is taller than his father)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Akosua good pass me for maths inside (Akosua is better than I in math)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E bad pass him bro
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          (He is worse than his brother)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      That is the preferred, more commonly used construction. Much less frequently used is the more expected form, which is still technically correct:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Kwame be taller than een poppie,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Akosua be better than me for maths inside
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      and
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        E be worse than him bro
      </li>
    </ul>
