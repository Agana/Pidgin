      Concord refers to agreement between the grammatical elements of a sentence. There are two forms of concord in English.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The fist is grammatical: the subject must agree with the verb in number.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The second is pronominal: any pronoun used must agree in number with the noun to which it refers (the antecedent).
    </p>

    Grammatical Concord
  </h3>
  <div id="chapter7Concord-markdown55" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Consider the following regular English sentence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I have tickets for the Kotoko game.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The reason we did not say “I has tickets for the Kotoko game” is down to subject verb agreement. The subject, “I”, goes with the plural “have” and not the singular “has”. Similarly,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        They see the dentist every year.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “We did not say “They sees the dentist every year”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In Pidgin English, when the statement is in the present tense the verb always takes the plural form (the first person I) form. So we would say:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I dey see the dentist every year                     (I see the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You dey see the dentist every year                (You see the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E dey see the dentist every year                     (He/She sees the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We dey see the dentist every year                  (We see the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You dey see the dentist every year                (You see the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Dem dey see the dentist every year               (They see the dentist every year)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The future tense uses a similar format, merely replacing the present marker “dey” with the future one “go”.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I go see the dentist next year                (I will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You go see the dentist next year          (You will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E go see the dentist next year               (He/She will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We go see the dentist next year           (We will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You go see the dentist next year          (You will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Dem go see the dentist next year         (They will see the dentist next year)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Note: When it is used as a future tense marker, &quot;go&quot; is intoned like the &quot;ex&quot; in &quot;exhale.&quot;
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      The past tense has already been seen. As in regular English, the same past tense form of the verb is always used. The only difference, and we have noted it already, is that Pidgin English does not inflect verbs for tense, but rather uses the simple present
      plural form. So the same sentences in the past render as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I see the dentist last year                       (I saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You see the dentist last year                 (You saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          E see the dentist last year                      (He/She saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          We see the dentist last year                   (We saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          You see the dentist last year                 (You saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Dem see the dentist last year                (They saw the dentist last year)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      No tense marker like “dey” or “go” is used. However, depending on the context one might hear:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        “I go see the dentist last year.”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In this instance, “go” means “went to”. So the statement means “I went and saw the dentist last year” or “I went to see the dentist last year”.
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Note: In this construction &quot;go&quot; is intoned like the &quot;small&quot; in &quot;a small problem.&quot; When it is used as a future tense marker, it is pronounced like the &quot;ex&quot; in &quot;exhale.&quot;
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Note: The takeaway is that you should always stick to the present plural form of the verb (the for that goes with I and we). This is true for main and auxiliary verbs. Just remember to add the marker “dey” in the present and “go” in the future.

  <div id="chapter7Concord-markdown57" class="show-list-numbers-and-dots">
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Consider the following sentence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I saw the tree that fell in the storm.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In this sentence the relative pronoun “that” refers to the subject, “the tree”. In such a construction, the subject is called the antecedent. It is called the antecedent because it occurs before the pronoun that refers back to it. The same applies in
      the sentence:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The President gave his big speech this morning.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      “His” is the pronoun; “The President” is the antecedent. In regular English the pronoun and the antecedent must agree in number and in gender. That’s why we did not say, “The President gave their big speech this morning” and we couldn’t say, “The man
      fell and broke her own back.”
    </p>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      In Pidgin English, maintaining pronoun-antecedent agreement is very easy. First of all, the pronouns are the same as we have learned. So the above statement would simply be:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Presido give him big speech this morning-t.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      Also:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          James take him son go school    (James took his son to school)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The soldiers never dey use dema guns    (The soldiers never use their guns)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          The ladies dey don dema makeup    (The ladies are putting on their makeup
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Sandra for change him plans    (Sandra must change her plans)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      So in instances where personal pronouns are used with antecedents, things are straightforward. When demonstratives are used, however, usually to refer to inanimate antecedents, then once again we rely on the term wey to do the job in all instances. It
      also replaces “who” in this context
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          I see the tree wey (e) fall for the storm inside    (I saw the tree that feel in the storm)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          This be the day wey the Lord make!    (This is the day that the Lord has made!)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p style="color:#000000;">
          Show me the boy wey (e) kill the giant    (Show me the boy who killed the giant)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p style="color:#000000;">
      As we have already said, “whom” does not occur at all in Pidgin, so wey plays its role as well:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I dey search the boy wey you describe am (I am looking for the boy whom you described)
      </li>
    </ul>
